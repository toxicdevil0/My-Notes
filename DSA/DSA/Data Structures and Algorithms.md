**Data Structures** is about how data can be stored in different structures.

**Algorithms** is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

We need DSA to solve different problems and to also land jobs in big tech firms.

Some of most common Data Structures are Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Array Lists, Heap Tables, Graphs, Trees, etc.

And Some of the most common Algorithms are Sorting, Searching, etc.
