Linked List is a type of list where one element is linked with another element but they are not in continuous or contagious manner like array, So all the elements are at random places but are all connected to each other in different manners.

Linked Lists can be differentiated using the way elements are connected to each other.
### 1. [[Singly Linked List]]- 
Where Elements are connected to each other using a single link or where you only have access to the very next element in the list.

### 2. [[Doubly Linked List]]- 
Where Elements are connected to each other using double links. Where an element knows where both next previous element is.

Where the last is connected to the first element or head.
