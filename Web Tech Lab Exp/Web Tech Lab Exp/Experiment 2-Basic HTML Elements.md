## Objective
Create web pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, images, hyperlinks, and tables using HTML, based on the MyGym Website project.

---

## Implementation in MyGym Website

### 1. Headings
The `index.html` file uses various heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure the content. For example:
```html
<h1>MyGym Website</h1>
<h2>Our Classes</h2>
```

### 2. Paragraphs
Paragraphs are used to provide information about the gym, classes, and other sections:
```html
<p>Welcome to MyGym, your destination for fitness and well-being.</p>
```

### 3. Lists
Both ordered and unordered lists are used to display features, class types, or steps:
```html
<ul>
  <li>Cardio</li>
  <li>Yoga</li>
  <li>Crossfit</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Register</li>
  <li>Join Classes</li>
  <li>Track Progress</li>
</ol>
```

### 4. Images
Images are included to enhance the visual appeal. For example, the hero section uses:
```html
<img src="images/hero-bg.jpg" alt="Gym Hero Background">
```

### 5. Hyperlinks
Navigation and external links are provided using anchor tags:
```html
<a href="#about">About Us</a>
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">External Site</a>
```

### 6. Tables
Tables can be used to display class schedules or pricing:
```html
<table>
  <tr><th>Class</th><th>Time</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Cardio</td><td>7:00 AM</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Yoga</td><td>8:00 AM</td></tr>
</table>
```

## How to View
Open `index.html` in your browser to see these elements in action. You can find the relevant code in the file and modify or extend it as needed for your lab submission.

---

## Screenshots
-> [[Exp 2 Screenshots]]
Include screenshots of the rendered headings, lists, images, hyperlinks, and tables from your website for your lab record.

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements in a real project context, forming the foundation for more advanced web development tasks.
